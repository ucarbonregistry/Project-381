Small Scale Wind Power Project in Amreli District

The proposed project titled under UCR is “Small Scale Wind Power Project in Amreli District”, which
is wind power project located in village - Kidi, district Amreli in the state of Gujarat (India). The
project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under
“Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

Purpose of the project activity:
The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of single Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) having capacity of 2 MW manufactured and
supplied by Inox Wind Limited in district Amreli of the state of Gujarat in India. This project has
been promoted by M/s Recall Alloys.

The WTG under the project activity was commissioned on 15/03/2022 by Gujarat Energy
Development Agency (GEDA), Government of Gujarat, India.

As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 3,504 MWh of electricity per
annum considering an average PLF of 20%. The Wheeling agreement is signed between Uttar
Gujarat Vij Company Ltd. (UGVCL) and PP. The project activity would be displacing equivalent
quantum of grid electricity resulting in emission reduction of 3,153 tCO2 per annum. The project
activity has been helping in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable resources
(wind energy) for generating power which otherwise would have been generated using grid mix
power plants, which is dominated by fossil fuel based thermal powerplants.

The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is
expected to be 3,153 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period
shall be submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification.

Since the project activity generates electricity through wind energy, a clean renewable energy source
it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change
mitigation efforts
